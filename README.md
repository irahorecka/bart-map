# bart-map
An application that will show you, in real-time, BART trains that are leaving (via BART map).

This project allows the user to view departing trains on a BART map, with trains denoted by black, circular points. Leaving trains may linger on the station for nearly a minute before it disappears.

Currently, there are no movements of points between stations, due to the points being plotted using ```matplotlib```. In the future, it would be nice to track train movement along the BART lines; however, I believe an alternative plotting method should be employed rather than overlaying scatter points on a BART map.
